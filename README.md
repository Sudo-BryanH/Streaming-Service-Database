# CPSC 304 Project

## Authorship:
This was a joint group project by Bryan Hui, Dhrubo Karmaker, and Harper Kim.

## Summary
Our project reflects and models streaming platforms in the music industry such as Spotify, Apple
Music, or YouTube Music. Our database will allow companies to manage content interactions
and payments between users, releases, artists, and distributors in their streaming services.
(Note: Our database only manages payments and transactions that occur in Canada.)

This project cannot be run and used as it connects to a priate MySQL server. To see how some aspects of the program works, view the Milestone 4 document in the milestones document.
