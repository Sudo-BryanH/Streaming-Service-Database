# CPSC 304 Project

## Summary
Our project reflects and models streaming platforms in the music industry such as Spotify, Apple
Music, or YouTube Music. Our database will allow companies to manage content interactions
and payments between users, releases, artists, and distributors in their streaming services.
(Note: Our database only manages payments and transactions that occur in Canada.)
