# Timeline

* Set up Oracle database -> 3/21 (3 days) 

* Write SQL to populate the database -> 3/23 (2 days) 

  Can use/modify the ones in M2 

* Design ui/front-end -> 3/28 (5 days) 

  * Entities grouped into one of payments, users, and releases, each will be handled by a group member 

  * Build pages/windows for each of the major entities mentioned above, e.g. one page for a form that handles the INSERT statements under the hood, and the other for displaying data in a readable format, handled by SELECT queries with WHERE clauses. 

  * Design and setup backend structure -> 4/1 (4 days) 

  * Set up main class, main UI instance, etc. 

  * Construct a skeleton consisting of interfaces and stub classes to plan out coupling and cohesion of various sections 

  * Possibly model the entities into Java classes of their own 

  * Decide and implement common objects and UI elements 

* Implement backend → 4/5 (4 days) 

    * Each group member implements their designs from Step 3 using the classes created in Step 4 

    * Create each endpoint methods that would be hit by the forms and buttons in the front-end classes 

    * Connect the backend to our SQL database 

* Wrap up → 4/7 (2 days) 

  * Finish any outstanding tasks 

  * Prepare application for presentation
